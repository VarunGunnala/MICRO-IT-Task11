### Overview of the Project


### Project: Unique Password Generator



### Objective
The objective of this project is to build a robust and unique password generator using Python. The aim is to create a tool that can generate highly secure and truly unique passwords based on user-defined criteria, such as length, inclusion of uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, minimizing the risk of predictable or easily guessable passwords.


### Key Activities
 * Character Set Definition: Defining comprehensive character sets for letters, numbers, and special symbols.
 * Randomization Algorithm Development: Developing a strong randomization algorithm to ensure unique and unpredictable password generation.
 * Parameter Customization: Implementing features allowing users to customize password length and character types.
 * Security Best Practices: Integrating best practices for secure password generation to enhance overall security.


### Technologies Used
 * Python: The primary programming language for developing the unique password generator.
 * random module: Utilized for generating random sequences and selections of characters.
 * String manipulation functions: Employed for constructing and handling password strings.
